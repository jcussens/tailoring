Idea here is to be modular and focus on readable code. Files are:

simple_opttree.c
code for tree building

workspace.c
provides working space (so as to avoid finding
new space during tree building)

tree.c
code for manipulating nodes/trees

sorted_set.c
code for policytree-style sorted sets

all other files are from other branches

have now added reading.c/h and type_all.h

Warning in policy_tree(x, gammas, depth, TRUE) :
  The number of covariates exceeds 50. Consider reducing the dimensionality before running policy_tree, by for example using only the Xj's with the highest variable importance (`grf::variable_importance` - the runtime of exact tree search scales with ncol(X)^depth, see the documentation for details).

seems correct.

Found bug, not initialising left_perfect and right_perfect - now
getting the right tree!

currently have two versions: sorted_sets and simple_sets. on binary
data the latter is far faster, on float data initial experiments show
sorted_sets faster. here's results on binary data:

For R package, looking at policytree.
There is a file tree_search.h which has a prototype for a function
tree_search.
The file Rcppbindings.cpp defines a function tree_search_rcpp which
calls tree_search.
The R file policy_tree.R defines a function policy_tree which calls
tree_search_rcpp

tree_search.h is a "normal" C++ header file
Rcppbindings.cpp is a C++ file that references Rcpp types. This is the
equivalent of rcpp_hello_world.cpp in the skeleton.
So need to write our own C/C++ file to translate NODE* type into an R list.

policytree approach
put root into queue
pop queue (now empty) and record stuff
push root->left_child
push root->right_child
pop root->left_child and record stuff
push root->left_child->left_child
push root->left_child->right_child
pop root->right_child

so process breadth-first, left to right.

To make R package
1. Ensure in correct directory
2. Start R
3. Do "library(Rcpp)"
4. Do "compileAttributes()" - this will generate wrapper code
5. Also, if needed, do library(roxygen2); roxygenise()" to update .Rd
files
6. Leave R
7. Do "R CMD build fastpolicytree"
8. Do "R CMD check fastpolicytree_1.0.tar.gz"
9. Do "sudo R CMD INSTALL fastpolicytree_1.0.tar.gz"

Fri 22 Mar 09:06:40 GMT 2024

to debug R which calls C/C++ code do: "R -d gdb"
CTRL-C to get gdb prompt
"continue" to get back to R process
