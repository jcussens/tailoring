Description: Constructs optimal policy trees which provide a rule-based treatment prescription policy.
 Input is covariate and reward data, where, typically, the rewards will be doubly robust reward estimates.
 This package aims to construct optimal policy trees more quickly than the existing policytree package and
 is intended to be used alongside that package.
