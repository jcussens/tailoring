Idea here is to be modular and focus on readable code. Files are:

simple_opttree.c
code for tree building

workspace.c
provides working space (so as to avoid finding
new space during tree building)

tree.c
code for manipulating nodes/trees

sorted_set.c
code for policytree-style sorted sets

all other files are from other branches
